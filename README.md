= Argos Firefox Launcher

I use Firefox profiles to keep my work separate -- using a separate profile for each of various work projects, personal projects, etc. This Argos extension finds and lists all Firefox profiles, to make it convenient to launch them. It also adds a menu item to launch the Firefox Profile Manager, making it convenient to add/remove/rename profiles.
